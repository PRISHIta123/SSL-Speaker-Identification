(f01) The Cinderella Story </A>
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(fs01) Once upon a time there was a girl called Cinderella.
<BR>
	(fs02) But everyone called her Cinders. 
<BR>
	(fs03) Cinders lived with her mother and two stepsisters called Lily and Rosa. 
<BR>
	(fs04) Lily and Rosa were very unfriendly and they were lazy girls. 
<BR>
	(fs05) They spent all their  time buying new clothes and going to parties. 
<BR>
	(fs06) Poor Cinders had to wear all their old hand-me-downs! 
<BR>
	(fs07) And she had to do the cleaning!
<BR>
	(fs08) One day, a royal messenger came to announce a ball. 
<BR>
	(fs09) The ball would be held at the Royal Palace, in honour of the Queen's only son, Prince William. 
<BR>
	(fs10) Lily and Rosa thought this was divine. 
<BR>
	(fs11) Prince William was gorgeous, and he was looking for a bride! 
<BR>
	(fs12) They dreamed of wedding bells! 
<BR>
	(fs13) When the evening of the ball arrived, Cinders had to help her sisters get ready. 
<BR>
	(fs14) They were in a bad mood. 
<BR>
	(fs15) They'd wanted to buy some new gowns, but their mother said that they had enough gowns. 
<BR>
	(fs16) So they started shouting at Cinders. 
<BR>
	(fs17) "Find my jewels!" yelled one.
<BR>
	(fs18) "Find my hat!" howled the other. 
<BR>
	(fs19) They wanted hairbrushes, hairpins and hair spray.
<BR>
