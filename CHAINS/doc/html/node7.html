RSI: Repetitive Synchronous Imitation</A>

For this condition, only the Cinderella fable was used.  It was divided into 19 individual phrases.  Subjects listened to a repeating loop in which a single phrase was uttered, and after the second repetition, they joined in, repeating the phrase six times in synchrony with the target.  They wore headphones through which a binaural mixture of their own voice and the target were heard.  This methodology was originally developed as a pedagogical tool in teaching prosody, especially pitch accents, to learners of Swedish as a second language [<A
 HREF="node30.html#harrer:97">3</A>].  It ought to produce a close match in timing and intonation to the given target. The recording released is the penultimate repetition, together with the target (left and right channels). In the case of dysfluencies, a fluent production preceding the penultimate was used.
