<BLOCKQUOTE>
The North Wind and the Sun were arguing one day about which of them was stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped up in an overcoat. They agreed that the one who could make the traveller take his coat off would be considered stronger than the other one. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the harder he blew, the tighter the traveller wrapped his coat around him; and at last the North Wind gave up trying. Then the Sun began to shine hot, and right away the traveler took his coat off. And so the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was stronger than he was.
